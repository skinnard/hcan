  text: <p>Rather than being snapped, as occurs with a broken arm, spinal vertebrae are compressed in the same way that a paper cup would be flattened when stepped on. Spinal cord compression fractures may be accompanied by pain, but in many instances, fractures of the spine may go unnoticed. Spine fractures due to osteoporosis can lead to pain and deformity, known as kyphosis, that may get worse over time.</p>
