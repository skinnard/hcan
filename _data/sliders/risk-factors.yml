  text: People who consume more than 2 units of alcohol per day have a 40% increased risk of osteoporotic fracture, compared to those who drink moderately or consume no alcohol whatsoever. High alcohol intakes can cause secondary osteoporosis due their adverse effects on bone-forming cells, the hormone responsible for regulating calcium metabolism.
