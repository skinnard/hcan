  content: '<p>Osteoporosis is a disease that affects your bones, thinning and weakening them, while also making them more likely to break or fracture. The most common types of osteoporotic breaks are those occurring in the spine, hip and wrist.

  data-url: healthandbone.ca/en/osteoporosis-faqs-content/?title=what-are-the-causes-of-osteoporosis
  content: '<p>Osteoporosis is caused as bone loss outpaces the growth of new bone. Bones become porous, brittle and prone to fracture. People reach peak bone mass in their early twenties. During the aging process, our bone cells start dissolving bone matrix (resorption), while new bone cells deposit osteoid (formation). This process is called remodelling.</p>'

  content: '<p>Osteoporosis is often called the "silent thief" because bone loss can occur without you even knowing it or feeling any symptoms. This bone loss does not occur overnight but over the course of several years. Sometimes the first sign that anything is wrong is a broken bone. While there are no visible symptoms, there are factors that may put you at a higher risk for osteoporosis. <a href="/en/osteoporosis-risk-assessment/">Take the Risk Assessment</a>.</p>'
